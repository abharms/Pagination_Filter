# Pagination_Filter

This project takes a list of HTML student records and paginates them with 10 results per page. The correct amount of pagination
buttons appear at the bottom based on the total number of student records.

The user can also search for student records and they will filter in real time.

The programming is written on the client side in jQuery.
